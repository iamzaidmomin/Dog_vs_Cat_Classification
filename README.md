This repository contains code and resources for a deep learning project focused on classifying images of dogs and cats. The goal of this project is to build and train a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats.

Key Features
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps, including resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and data augmentation.
Model Architecture: Implementation of a deep learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification.
Training: Code and information related to model training, including loss and accuracy metrics over epochs.
Evaluation: Evaluation metrics and code to assess the model's performance on a test dataset.
Inference: Code for making predictions on new images using the trained model.
Dataset: Information on the dataset used for training and validation. (Note: You should specify the source of your dataset and ensure you have the necessary permissions to use it.)
Results: Detailed information on model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Instructions and resources for deploying the model for inference in a real-world application (if applicable).
